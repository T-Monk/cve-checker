This application is responsible for downloading all of the new CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database (https://nvd.nist.gov/) and providing them in a specific format.

## Thoughts and Future Plans

We now have a very simple Spring Boot application that can be used to download the latest CVEs in a zipped file to the /tmp directory when a user clicks a link on our (very) basic home page. 

At the moment the URL (from which the CVEs are downloaded) and the path to the target local directory are hard-coded. The next thing we would like to achieve is the ability for the user to specify where the files are downloaded to. As we now setup a front-end development environment, we can add a field to our home page that will allow a user to specify the desired download location. 

After this, we will concentrate on adding functionality that will allow a user to specify a custom time period from which the CVEs should be downloaded (i.e., a user might only be interested in CVEs in the last week). When this functionality is in place on the server, we will make additions to the client.
