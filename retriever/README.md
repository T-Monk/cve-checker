This application is responsible for downloading all of the new CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database (https://nvd.nist.gov/) and providing them in a specific format.

## Thoughts and Future Plans

We now have a very simple Spring Boot application which can be used to download the latest CVEs in a zipped file to the /tmp directory. At the moment the URL and path to the target local directory are hard-coded. The next thing we would like to achieve is the ability for the user to specify the URL and target path. One way to do this would be to use a query string, however, later we will want to have a proper UI in the browser, so this seems like a good opportunity to start integrating a front-end.
