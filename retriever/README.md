This application is responsible for downloading all of the new CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database (https://nvd.nist.gov/) and providing them in a specific format.

## Thoughts and Future Plans

We now have a very simple Spring Boot application that can be used to download the latest CVEs as a zipped file to a location that can be specified by the user. 

We acknowledge that we havenâ€™t implemented any testing or safety precautions for this functionality and want to make it clear we will not be doing so. This is a conscious decision based on the fact that this functionality will soon be removed. We do not want the CVEs to be downloaded, instead, we want them to be displayed in the browser. We implemented this functionality as it was relatively simple to implement and provides a solid foundation to develop the functionality we actually want.

Now we will concentrate on adding functionality that will allow a user to specify a custom time period from which the CVEs should be downloaded (i.e., a user might only be interested in CVEs in the last week) and then provide the ability for these to be displayed in the browser.
