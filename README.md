## Retriever

In order to analyse CVEs, we first need to retrieve all of the CVEs that we are yet to analyse from the National Vulnerability Database (https://nvd.nist.gov/). The retriever will be responsible to downloading all of the new CVEs and providing them in a specific format ready for analysis.

## Requirements

In the future I am planning on using ansible to fully automate the setup, however, for now I will keep detailed instructions of everything required to build and run the project.

1. OpenJDK version 11 or higher;
2. Maven;
3. Node.

## Usage

Currently we are just developing the application, so for the time being we will start the server and client separately.  

To start the back-end: 
```
cd retriever
mvn spring-boot:run
```

To start the front-end:
```
cd retriever/src/main/app/
npm start
```
