## Retriever

In order to analyse CVEs, we first need to retrieve all of the CVEs that we are yet to analyse from the National Vulnerability Database (https://nvd.nist.gov/). The retriever will be responsible to downloading all of the new CVEs and providing them in a specific format ready for analysis.

## Requirements

In the future I am planning on using ansible to fully automate the setup, however, for now I will keep detailed instructions of everything required to build and run the project.

1. OpenJDK version 11 or higher;
2. Maven
